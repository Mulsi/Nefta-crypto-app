# Nefta Crypto App

This repository contains an app built with Angular which utilizes the MetaMask browser extension and enables the end user to send crypto coins to a specific address on selected EVM chain.

## Requirements
* Angular CLI -> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.
* node.js version 16 or higher
* MetaMask browser extensions

## Instructions
* npm install
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

1.  Select desired chain in the dropdown
2. Enter recipient address in hexadecimal
3. Enter the desired amount of coins to be sent
4. I personally tested transactions with Ganache `https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/` which creates a personal Ethereum blockain.
